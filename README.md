A set of DataField developed using ConnectIQ SDK.
I'm owner of an Edge 520 and a ForeRunner 235...

##lapElevation
What's lap elevation? I love climbs.. and most of my time I'd like to known how many meters uphill I traveled from the start of climb. The only "option" that I have on my "climb screen" is the elevation+ field available on device and it's all. I downloaded the SDK and wrote it.


## How to transfer?
How use this field on your Garmin? It's simple. Compile it and transfer the prg file into <DEVICE>/Garmin/Apps folder.
